                <p>OK. So for everyone that hasn't heard of it (what are you doing with your life?), Undertale is a RPG
                    created by Toby Fox. In this RPG, you dont have to kill anyone. Each enemy can be “deafeated”
                    nonviolently. Dance with the slime. Pet the dog. Whisper your favorite secret to a knight. Or ignore
                    this choice and rain destruction upon your foes. If this doesn't sound like the most fun game to
                    ever exist I would suggest visiting a doctor...</p>

        <h3 class="character-info-title">Meet Frisk!</h3>
        <p class="character-info">Frisk is the playable character, main protagonist, and the eighth human in Undertale.
            After falling into the
            Underground, they venture to return to the surface, whether neutrally, genocidally, or peacefully. The
            latter case, the True Pacifist Route, is the only one where Frisk's name is revealed, emphasizing they are
            not the "fallen human" that is named by the player.</p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">Frisk's personality is usually ambiguous, allowing the player to project any
            personality onto Frisk since
            they're very often speechless to them. However, the narration that describes Frisk's actions occasionally
            changes depending on their LOVE. Frisk speaks to NPCs throughout the game, especially when ACTing in
            encounters, but the exact dialogue is shown only when the game gives multiple dialogue options. NPCs'
            dialogue boxes display "..." to show that the NPC is listening to Frisk, and some NPCs respond to
            questions that Frisk asks.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            Depending on their actions, players can interpret Frisk as merciful and kind, or merciless and violent. Some
            NPCs emphasize Frisk's kindness, understanding, and grace in the epilogue. Frisk is obedient and only
            disallows player input when they follow someone else's instructions, such as when Sans tells them to hide
            behind the conveniently-shaped lamp.

        <p class="character-info">
            Flowey is the first major character that the protagonist encounters in Undertale. Flowey
            serves as the main antagonist for the Neutral and True Pacifist routes, and can be considered a
            deuteragonist for the Genocide Route. He provides an introduction to the mechanics of encounters by sharing
            "friendliness pellets," which are actually harmful bullets, revealing his philosophy of "KILL or BE KILLED."
            He serves as the final boss of the Neutral Route.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Initially, Flowey operates under a facade of friendliness and politeness. He often greets the protagonist
            with southern slang, such as "Howdy!", calls himself "your best friend," and, like his father, appends
            polite words such as "golly" to the ends of his sentences. Whenever he drops this guise of friendliness, he
            often calls the protagonist an "idiot."

            Underground. Toriel is the former queen of the monsters, the ex-wife of Asgore, the mother of Asriel, the
            adoptive mother of the first human, and the first boss, as she guards the Ruins exit.

            Toriel is a kind monster that acts as a protective mother figure for the protagonist. She is sincere in
            expressing her love through words and actions, such as when she was married to Asgore. She employs tough

        <p class="character-info">
            Toriel's hobbies includes baking, reading, writing puns, bug-hunting, and tending to flowers. She enjoys

        <h3 class="character-info-title">Meet Sans!</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Sans is the older brother of Papyrus and a major character in Undertale. He first appears in
            Snowdin Forest after the protagonist exits the Ruins. Sans is the deuteragonist of the Neutral and True
            Pacifist routes, in which he keeps an eye on the protagonist throughout the game. He is also the final boss
            of the Genocide Route.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Sans is lazy, often sleeping on the job and taking breaks. His laziness is a combination of fatalism and
            apathy, as he is aware of timeline resets. Conversely, he suggests that this knowledge could be "a poor
            excuse for being lazy."
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            He enjoys being mischievous. Sans primarily acts this way towards those he is in good terms with. His antics
            range from an assortment of illogical, juvenile, and slightly inconvenient pranks. Examples include Sans
            "selling fried snow," using whoopee cushions, sharing an unscrewed ketchup bottle, and eye paint on a
            telescope. He is not above utilizing his teleportation or other magic for practical jokes either.

        <h3 class="character-info-title">Meet Papyrus!</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Papyrus is Sans's younger brother, a major character, and the second boss in
            Undertale. Papyrus wants to become a Royal Guard to gain fame and friends. He patrols and prepares many of
            Snowdin Forest's puzzles in hopes of capturing a human and earning his goal.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Papyrus is a flamboyant skeleton who presents a confident, charismatic image of himself. He is thought to
            have an egotistical personality, referring to himself as "THE GREAT PAPYRUS," possibly as a way to feel as
            prestigious as his brother. He works hard and, despite his brash personality, is kind at heart. He is
            optimistic and brave, and is shown to be considerate and forgiving even when the protagonist beheads him in
            the Genocide Route.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            He is also occasionally oblivious and nonobservant, but can be cunning at
            times, as seen when he uses reverse psychology to trick Undyne into befriending the protagonist. He is
            thought of to be somewhat naive by other characters, but not dumb. He shows great bravery as even in the
            face of potentially imminent death, he drops his guard and spares the protagonist hopes of driving them down
            a better path.

        <p class="character-info">
            Undyne, is a major character and the third boss in Undertale. Undyne leads the
            Royal Guard, which protects Asgore and patrols the Underground to find humans. She pursues the protagonist
            throughout Waterfall, though she is inadvertently thwarted by Monster Kid.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Undyne is passionate about everything that she does. She acts quickly on her ideas and is steadfast in her
            beliefs. Though she wants to defeat the protagonist, she also tries to be fair and offers an explanation
            of how Green Mode works. Asgore taught her the value of pacifism, which is why Undyne sees the
            protagonist as "a wimpy loser with a big heart." When the protagonist first encounters her, she fights to
            further Asgore's plan of collecting seven human SOULs but, if the protagonist shows mercy, Undyne just as
            quickly defends them from Asgore.

        <p class="character-info">
            Alphys is a female, reptilian monster that lives in the lab in western Hotland. She
            is the incumbent Royal Scientist, a position she was awarded by Asgore after the disappearance of her
            predecessor. She is a major character in Undertale and the only one not to fight the protagonist.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Alphys is a shy introvert who frequently stutters when she converses. She has low self-esteem, makes
            self-deprecating comments, and devalues her skills at times. True to her role as a scientist,
            Alphys is intelligent, analytical, and observant. She occasionally theorizes on matters, and can create
            thorough plans from them. She can create inventions that use metal and magic, such as a "magical spear
            repair kit." Alphys is adept in programming, robotics, and mechanical engineering. She is agile
            when she works a project, and has formal writing when documenting her research.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            Alphys is passionate in her work and interests. She often gets excited when sharing her opinions. Alphys's
            hobbies include enjoying human anime, manga, and video games. Alphys is also fond of shipping,
            writing fanfiction, posting online content, and writing walkthroughs for games. For the latter, Alphys
            prefers giving solutions as a last resort.

        <h3 class="character-info-title">Meet Mettaton!</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Mettaton is a major character and the fourth boss in Undertale. Mettaton is a robot with a SOUL, whose body
            was built by Alphys. He is the sole television star of the Underground. Mettaton poses as an entertainment
            robot turned human killing robot in Hotland, though he later reveals the truth to the protagonist at the end
            of the CORE.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Mettaton is a confident, charismatic, and charming TV host that loves drama, action, and violence. He lives
            for his ratings and adores performing. He supposedly strikes a pose when he does something wrong and makes
            time on his various shows to beat up "heel-turning villains." He shows a rather shallow appreciation for
            existence at times. He has a strong craving for attention and seems very egotistical, shown when he boasts
            about the beauty of his true form. However, despite his seemingly self-centered personality, he deeply cares
            about the seemingly positive impact his show has had on the inhabitants of the Underground. He has also
            shown soft spots for several characters, such as Alphys and Napstablook.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            He also appears to be among the
            fewer characters in the Underground that has no hate or prejudice against humans despite knowing about the
            monsters' history with them, since his initial attempts to kill the protagonist were just him playing along
            with Alphys's plan, and he outright tells the protagonist he has no desire to hurt humans and is far more
            interested in simply entertaining. While he did attempt to kill the protagonist, it was to prevent Asgore
            from taking their SOUL and be seen as a hero/savior to humankind, further emphasizing his lack of prejudice.

        <p class="character-info">
            Asgore Dreemurr is the ruler of the Underground and its denizens,
            monsters. He serves as one of the main antagonists of Undertale, planning to kill seven humans and use their
            SOULs to break the barrier that traps everyone Underground. However, he is not evil or malicious. Asgore is
            the ex-husband of Toriel, father of Asriel, adoptive father of the first human, and the penultimate boss of
            the Neutral Route.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Asgore is a kind and often quiet yet upbeat monster that enjoys gardening, Golden Flower Tea, and
            Toriel's Butterscotch Pie. Like his son, he speaks in southern slang (most notably "howdy" and "golly").
            Before his battle, he offers the protagonist many opportunities to explore the Underground and is reluctant
            to fight them at all; he even suggests that Toriel, the protagonist and himself live as a family if the
            protagonist spares him.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            Asgore lives in the past and wants nothing more than to see his wife and child again, even though they have
            been gone for a long time. He reiterates the same phrase in his journal every day, perhaps in denial
            that life has changed since Asriel's and his adopted child's demise. Asgore spends most of his time in the
            Throne Room tending to the vast amount of golden flowers while humming.

        <p class="character-info">
            Asriel Dreemurr is the biological child of Toriel and Asgore and the adoptive
            brother of the first human. He serves as the final boss of the True Pacifist Route, replacing Asgore in New
            Home. Despite his late introduction, his presence as Flowey as well as in Undertale's backstory makes him a
            major character.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Before his death, Asriel was a docile, loving, and gentle child. Asriel was compassionate, as he helped the
            injured fallen human despite The War of Humans and Monsters. In the VHS Tapes, Asriel's dialogue implied he
            highly trusted the fallen human, as they continued their plan to break the Barrier to free monsterkind.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            As Flowey, he lacks a SOUL and becomes incapable of feeling love. This saddens him initially, as he blames
            himself for his fate. Eventually, he became resentful and murderous.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            After temporarily regaining his compassion, Asriel regrets adopting the "kill or be killed" philosophy and
            apologizes for his actions to the protagonist, understanding that they may not forgive him.

        <h3 class="character-info-title">Meet Chara!</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            Chara, also known as the fallen human, is the first human to fall into the Underground. Chara is their "true
            name" on the naming screen, though their name typically varies on what the player enters. They are distinct
            from the eighth fallen human, who is the protagonist of Undertale. As a major character, Chara's primary
            role is described through the Dreemurr's backstories, though Chara also appears at the end of the Genocide
            Route.
        </p>
        <h3 class="character-info-title">Personality</h3>
        <p class="character-info">
            While initially cast in a sympathetic light, Asriel admits at the end of the True Pacifist Route that Chara
            "...wasn't really the greatest person." Asriel explains Chara climbed Mount Ebott for an unhappy reason,
            and that they "hated humanity." However this is only meant to illustrate that he has stopped idolizing
            his former sibling. It does not necessarily mean that Chara was completely heartless or psychopathic. In the
            VHS Tapes, Chara is implied to be mischievous, and can make a "creepy face" with a certain smile. Chara
            is also intelligent, secretive, and persuasive. Chara does not let their plan be recorded on the camera,
            and they gain Asriel's trust to continue their plan. At one point, Asgore noticed Chara once had a sense
            of hope in their eyes.
        </p>
        <p class="character-info">
            There is evidence to suggest that some narration, as well as descriptions of certain actions and events, is
            by Chara themself. However, the narrator throughout the entirety of Undertale is up to speculation.
